# Setup & Usage
**After installing Flask, you have a couple of options to run your application:**

➡️ Option 1: Using flask run (The standard way)

If your main application file is named app.py (or application.py), you can usually run it with:
```
flask run --debug
```
This assumes Flask can automatically discover your application.


➡️ Option 2: Using python -m flask (If you need to specify the app)

If your application is in a file named something other than the defaults, you can specify it like this:
```
python -m flask --app ./app.py run --debug
```
